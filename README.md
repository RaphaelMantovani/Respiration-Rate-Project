# Respiration-Rate-Project

This project is using computer vision to calculate the respiration rate of lying dairy cows. By analyzing the difference in average pixel intensity in annotated bounding boxes and performing Fast Fourier Transform to select the most prevalent data, this model predicts the number of times a cow breathed in a 30-second interval.
